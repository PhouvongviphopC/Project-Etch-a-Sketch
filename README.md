# Project Etch-a-Sketch

A simple web-based Etch-a-Sketch application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Draw by hovering over the grid squares, clear or reset the grid, and resize it to your preference!

## Features

- **Draw**: Hover over squares to color them blue.
- **Clear**: Reset all squares to the initial color without changing the grid size.
- **Reset**: Reset all squares and recreate the default 16x16 grid.
- **Resize**: Choose a custom grid size (e.g., 16x16, 32x32).

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Use the buttons below the grid to clear, reset, or resize the grid.
